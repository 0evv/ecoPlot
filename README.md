### ecoPlot

Google Maps Javascript API framework for the *Green Action Rhode Island* website, a community action group focused on cleaning up trash in our local communities.

Essentially this is just my fiddling with Google's API, and trying to customize it as best I can to make it work for the intended purpose.

TODO:
- Add some sort of user-input for community-supported action-site identification
- Add maps for different areas of the state/region
